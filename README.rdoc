= Terminator support for Consular

This gem is an add-on to Consular that implements support for the Terminator
terminal emulator on Linux.

Since Terminator does not have an API for controlling it, a commandline tool
called `xdotool` is used to send keyboard shortcuts to a running Terminator
in order to control it.
